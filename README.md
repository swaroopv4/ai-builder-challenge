# Asset tracking challenge

A take-home challenge for software engineering interns. Candidates build a frontend on top of a small local backend that simulates the operational asset tracking system of a multi-site research lab.

This is a **monorepo** with two apps you run side by side:

- [`api/`](./api) — small Node/Fastify backend with a seeded SQLite database. Candidates don't modify it.
- [`starter/`](./starter) — the Next.js starter that candidates fork. Has the API client wired up, types, primitives, and stub pages.

## Quick start

```bash
pnpm install

# Runs the API on :8080 and the starter on :3000
pnpm dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000.

The starter reads `API_BASE_URL` and `API_TOKEN` from `starter/.env` (defaults: `http://localhost:8080/v1` and a placeholder token). Copy `starter/.env.example` to `starter/.env` if you don't have one. Both are server-side only — the browser talks to a proxy at `/api/upstream` that attaches the token, so it never reaches the client.
